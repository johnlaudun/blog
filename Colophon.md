Sites like this are, across multiple dimensions, labors of love: people take the time to build them because they like playing with technology, because they like sharing what they have learned or what they are working on, or because they like spending entirely too much time deep in the weeds of the technologies that lie behind the thing we call the *Intarweb*. 

The current version of this site is built entirely using open source technologies and I wanted to do that in order to explore ways of building websites that would be useful, and as cheap as possible, for interested students and colleagues. The site before you now runs on [GitHub pages][]. It is built "code-less": I do not run Ruby locally and then "deploy" the site to a web server. Rather, I write everything in plain text, markdown for the posts and pages you see here, and then I push the repository in which all those plain documents reside up to GitHub, which then processes them into the HTML that you are reading right now. (Like Moliere's gentleman discovering he already spoke prose, perhaps you have just now discovered that you read HTML! *All the time.*) 

The work I have done is to develop templates and style sheets -- along with some Amazon AWS scribbles to deliver media --  to make the actual running of this website "code-less". If that interests you, then you are welcome to step into the equipment shed and see how this thing is held together with licks, promises, bailing wire, and assorted other miscellany from old folk sayings: [GitHub repo][].
