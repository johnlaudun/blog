Much of the computational work on texts focuses either on the very large texts that are the focus of digital humanities (also now sometimes computational/digital literary studies), like novels, or the very small texts that are the focus of so many computer/information science studies, like social media posts. Computational folkloristics have slowly begun to build a case for the middle ground of texts as a place where meaning and structure can be successfully mapped by the appropriate application of natural language processing (NLP) and, if one considers it separate, machine learning (ML). My work  Tim Tangherlini and Rob Howard, among others, who has steadfastly pursued a line of inquiry focused on the middle-ground of texts and textuality.

My work is focused on understanding the role that discourse plays in the nature and spread of online and offline texts. My principle interest is in narrative texts, in understanding how they are constructed, deployed, and received both because of the ways narrative activates our imaginations, seemingly syncing our brains, and the ways that narrative, as one of many modes of discourse, seems able to make words stick together as they travel across social networks. The focus on the somewhat larger horizon of discourse, as opposed to strictly narrative, is the outcome of years of close examination of actual vernacular texts as they passed between individuals both in face-to-face interaction and online.

## Origins

My training in post-structuralist theories about texts led me to folklore studies, where my  early research explored how individuals use available discourse structures to negotiate complex socio-cultural landscapes often riven by political and economic divisions. In mapping how urban Appalachians, African Americans, and Midwesterners manipulate available cultural forms (Laudun 2000, 2003, 1999), my goal was to understand how individuals use available syntaxes, which often seek in the case of the Urban Appalachians to write over them quite literally, in order to articulate alternative interpretations.

Much of this early work is qualitative and close, but it always has an eye to what is generalizable and, though I would not have described it this way at the time, operationalizable. Approaching texts as discourse, as a series of words grouped into syntactic clusters that arise out of longer strings words exchanged between individuals within a larger social network/group, the early essays identify ways that speakers manipulate time, authority and other domains through both semantic and pragmatic dimensions. One example stands for many: while working with Elizabeth Bridgwaters, an elder of the African American community in a small Midwestern town, she observed:

> It’s interesting you know.  
>
> When I was a little girl  
>
> most black people lived on the east side of town.  
>
> But some black people lived over here.  
>
> But they didn’t want us over there.  
>
> So they built a school over here.

Using carefully considered ideational couplets, Ms. Bridgwaters captures, via shifting pronomial reference, what it feels like to be displaced, to be turned by institutional syntaxes into a “them.” My later work with African Americans in a Louisiana small town has similar research goals, the development of frameworks that made analysts move past considerations of plot and theme to how texts actually achieve their effects. This has blossomed into a series of essays, some of which involved collaborators and one of which has been translated into Chinese, that have focused on a small corpus of legends that have created space for the articulation of a theory of vernacular/folk discourse (2014, 2018, 2021, 2023). As this research line continued, the lack of ability to expand beyond a small number of texts became a pain point. An invitation to the NEH seminar on Network Studies for the Humanities at UCLA’s Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics solidified my sense that the missing piece of the puzzle was an adequate understanding of quantitative methods and their concomitant theories. 

## Developments 

While I was already committed to a long-term ethnographic project (2016a), there was time as that work concluded and moved towards publication to embark upon smaller studies that charted possible quantitative approaches to humanities topics, including issues about disciplinarity (Goodwin and Laudun 2013) and sentiment as a way to imagine Kurt Vonnegut’s “shape of stories” (Gao et al 2016). 

In a moment of serendipity, as the culmination of the ethnographic project was headed into production as _The Amazing Crawfish Boat_, I was invited to return to UCLA’s Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics to be a part of the Cultural Analytics long program (Spring-Summer 2016). There I met Katie Kinnaird and we began a collaboration that has yielded two essays, one published and one under consideration, and a book project all its own, _The Data Text Book_, which attempts to bridge the large territory that exists between the data, computer, and information sciences and the computational humanities. Our goal is both to find ways to clearly define and explain humanities stapes, like “theme,” as well as to compare them over and against working substitutes, like topics, to suggest what can be modeled already and what is yet to be modeled in compelling ways.

Talk about the strand of research that is boats, then trucks, then folk ideas and its likelihood of merging with the work on narrative in _How Stories Work_.

At the heart of this lies the nature, and status, of narrative itself, a much vaunted but still remarkably not well understood mode of discourse. My efforts here are to understand how individuals use narrative to shape various dimensions of the world as they understand it: time, space, the interactional order. The goal of this work is to build a computational model of narrative such that we can discern narrative from other modes of discourse and begin to understand its place within the larger stream of vernacular discourse, themselves situated within global information flows. One argument, for example, has been that the cognitive mirroring enabled by narrative helps in the spread of fake news and in radicalization processes. And yet the status of legends as narrative within folklore studies has long been subject to discussion, calling into question the narrative nature of those forms which rest upon legend, like fake news. A proper accounting of narrative within legend and fake news would go a long way to clarifying the dynamics of these phenomena.

The oldest strand of work that continues to generate some activity began in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes that struck Louisiana, when I embarked upon an exploration of the relationship between culture and landscape. Driven to understand how individuals worked and lived in places dismissed as wetlands, I discovered a tradition of invention that had developed the crawfish boat, an amphibious vehicle that tumbled out of a loose network of Cajun and German farmers and fabricators. Explaining this phenomenon required actor-network theory, and I continue to refine that work as a way of engaging my home discipline of folklore studies in the necessity of re-thinking our work in light of developments in network theory.
